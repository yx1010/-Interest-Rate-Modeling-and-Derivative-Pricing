•	Simulated short-term interest rates using both the Vasicek and CIR models, applying the Euler method to analyze the impact of parameters (mean reversion speed, volatility) on rate trajectories, and ensuring statistical convergence to theoretical long-term values.
•	Calibrated CIR model parameters by minimizing error between simulated and market zero-coupon bond prices, using iterative optimization to refine values and enhance model accuracy.
•	Priced an ATM swaption using the calibrated CIR model, calculating the fair swap rate, and applying the Black-Scholes framework to estimate implied volatility, demonstrating proficiency in interest rate derivatives pricing and risk assessment.
